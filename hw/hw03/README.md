### Let me introduce myself:
# My name is Lena.

I grew up in Ukraine where I got master degree in Electronics from Kiev Polytechnic Institute. I enjoy jogging, hiking and skiing. I lived many years in Germany, Belgium and Denmark and moved to the US recently.
 
I used to work for several multinational companies:

-   Coca-Cola
-   Sony 
-   Ericsson Mobile

I was not panicking when yesterday I entered the Python class and saw students who are of age of my daughter. I enjoy being around others and work well with people. I also like to challenge myself so that I can become better at everything I do, in both work and my private life.
